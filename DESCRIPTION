Description: Enable plotting of graphics elements (e.g. points, lines, segments) in any position between two predefined positions. The central function is animator() which takes care about the repeated plotting of graphical elements in different positions. As a simple example, user can define the start and end positions of a point and animator() will produce plots of the point between those positions. The result is an animated impression of the point moving along the screen.
