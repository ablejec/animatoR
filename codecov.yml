Create Secret String

Secret strings are custom values encoded with unique repository information so that you may include sensative information inside your yaml file. These secret strings can be made public as their contents can only be decoded by Codecov backend and require information not presented to any end-user.

Validate Syntax

curl --data-binary @codecov.yml https://codecov.io/validate
